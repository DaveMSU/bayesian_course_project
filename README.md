# bayesian_course_project
Main class work on the course "Bayesian methods", which are taught at the Moscow State University at the Faculty of CMC. Here we consider the Kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance, by using Linear models for comparison Bayesian based models and classic.

# There are 3 notebooks in this repository:
 - In which LinearRegression from sklearn library is considered.
 - In which linear regression is considered, but trained using Bayesian theory using the pymc3 library.
 - In which the pymc model. Various statistics, tests, and confidence intervals are considered in detail. Also, the quality of convergence depends on how correct c is, which is important for pymc3. Convergence of the pymc model.

Also, in order not to clutter notebook with a lot of code, which is also often duplicated, a small custome library is written here.
